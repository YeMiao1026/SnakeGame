Please help me build a Snake Game using HTML + CSS + JavaScript (vanilla, no frameworks). The game should include the following features:

1. Main Menu (UI)

A central menu screen with the following options:

Single Player

Single Player vs AI

Multiplayer (Online)

A clean and centered layout with hover effects for buttons.

The title "Snake Game" is displayed at the top.

2. Single Player Mode

The game board is a square grid rendered in a Canvas.

The player controls the snake using WASD keys.

Normal food spawns randomly:

Eating food makes the snake longer.

Eating food increases movement speed.

Score is displayed at the top-left corner.

If the snake collides with itself → Game Over, with a "Restart" button shown.

3. Single Player vs AI

The player controls their snake, while an AI-controlled snake plays against them.

AI behavior logic:

Chases the nearest food.

Tries to avoid walls and player collisions.

Difficulty settings:

Easy: moves somewhat randomly.

Normal: targets food but not always avoids collisions.

Hard: smarter pathfinding, avoids traps, and aggressively goes for food.

Win/Lose conditions:

If either the player or AI crashes into itself or the other snake → that snake dies.

If the timer ends, the player with the higher score wins.

The AI snake should be clearly distinguishable with a different color.

Game rules:

Each player has their own snake with a unique color.

Food spawns are managed by the server and synced across clients.

Death conditions:

Hitting oneself → death.

Hitting the opponent’s body → death.

Head-to-head collision → both die.

When a player dies, broadcast the result and display the winner.

The game UI should also show a player list and scores below the canvas.

5. Special Foods (Power-ups & Hazards)

In addition to normal food, special food items spawn randomly:

Bonus Food (Gold): Grants +5 extra points, no speed increase.

Slow Down Food (Blue): Temporarily decreases snake speed for 3 seconds.

Poison Food (Purple): Decreases score and shortens snake by 2 segments.

Invisible Food (White/Transparent): Makes the snake’s tail invisible for 5 seconds.

Spawn rules:

Every 10 seconds, one random special food may appear.

Only one special food can exist at a time.

Each special food has a distinct color to differentiate it.

6. Technical Requirements

Provide complete working code with comments:

index.html → main menu + game canvas

style.css → basic UI styling

script.js → front-end game logic (supports single player, AI, and multiplayer with special foods)

server.js → Node.js WebSocket server (manages game state sync for multiplayer)

The code should run directly without external frameworks.
